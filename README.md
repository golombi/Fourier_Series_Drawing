# Fourier_Series_Drawing
Visualization of a user's drawing as a sum of rotating vectors using the Fourier Series and the FFT

This program allows the user to draw a shape via continuous mouse motion, preferably a loop, 
treats it as a periodic complex function changing with time,
and uses the Fourier Series to regenrate that drawing as sum of rotating vectors,
where the calculations involve the FFT to perform numerical integration to find the complex coofficients of the series.

I wrote the script to acquire hands-on experience in signal processing in my free time,
while looking forward to get deeper into the field and include RF and RT/Embedded SE in future projects alongside it.
